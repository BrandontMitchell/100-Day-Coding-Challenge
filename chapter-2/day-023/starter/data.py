import pandas as pd

# Two primary components of pandas are Series and DataFrames
# Multiple series make up a dataframe

data = {
    # create a dict (dataframe) here
}

purchases = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(data) # lets see the difference between raw data and a dataframe

# We can specify the indexes or columns in our data


# We can locate specified indexes called querying an item


# Convert to different formats


# can also convert to sql, but we don't have a db setup to do so


# viewing our data


# check if we have any null values


# check top 10 baby names in the list


# lets locate if your name is in the popular name list
